I led frontend development and SDK work for a no-code voice AI platform that digitizes indigenous African languages and deploys multilingual agents across voice and web channels.

- Led the UI development with React and TypeScript, integrating conversational voice agents into the Agent Pro web app.
- Implemented SWR-based real-time data fetching to keep agent state and call information responsive.
- Built and published the Agent Pro SDK (npm & CDN) to make embedding the platform straightforward for client developers.
- Designed CRM workflow integrations to automate lead and task management for AI-driven interactions.
