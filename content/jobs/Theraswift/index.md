I helped build a healthcare mobile application focused on appointments, teleconsults, and real-time communication.

- Spearheaded the application's architecture to improve scalability and performance.
- Built the frontend with React Native and TypeScript to improve responsiveness and UX.
- Implemented Context API-based state management and utilities for maintainability.
- Leveraged real-time sockets to deliver low-latency messaging and notifications.
