I built the frontend and backend features for a class/booking platform, integrating AI helpers and real-time collaboration tools.

- Built the frontend with Next.js, focusing on performance and an optimized UX.
- Integrated DALL·E and GPT helpers to improve content creation for instructors.
- Integrated Stripe (with Apple/Google Pay) to streamline payments and checkout flows.
- Implemented real-time chat and notifications with Firebase to boost engagement.
