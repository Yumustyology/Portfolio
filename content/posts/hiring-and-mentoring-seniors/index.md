Hiring senior engineers is not about finding the smartest person, it's about finding the one who elevates the team.

Guidelines I follow:

- Look for patterns of impact, not just technical puzzles: did they mentor others, ship features, and reduce operational toil?
- Use work-sample interviews (take-home or design exercises) that mirror the actual problems candidates will face.
- Invest in onboarding documentation and pairing rotations; senior hires accelerate faster when paired with clear context and domain knowledge.
- Make mentoring explicit: set goals, measure progress, and give feedback frequently. Mentorship scales when it's structured.

When hiring, prioritize empathy and communication — technical ability without collaborative skill creates brittle systems.
