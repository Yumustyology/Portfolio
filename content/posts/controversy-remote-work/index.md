This is intentionally controversial: remote work as commonly practiced is broken because it treats location as a silver bullet rather than addressing organizational design.

Problems I observe:

- Asynchronous communication is often used as an excuse for poor onboarding and unclear responsibilities. If you can't document a decision in a sentence, async will bury it.
- Meetings multiply to compensate for missed context; distributed teams spend more time coordinating than deciding.
- Compensation and career paths still favor in-office visibility in many companies, creating inequities remote-first teams promised to solve.

How to fix it:

- Define explicit collaboration contracts: meeting norms, async writeup templates, and decision owners for every product area.
- Measure outcomes, not presence. Track delivery against outcomes and make visibility objective and fair across locations.
- Invest in onboarding and shared rituals that transfer context quickly — asynchronous alone won't substitute for intentional knowledge transfer.

If we want distributed work to succeed, we need to stop treating remote as a policy and start treating it as an engineered product with clear contracts and guardrails.
