A small JavaScript/TypeScript utility that generates unique profile images from usernames, it creates a canvas, picks a randomized background color with a contrasting text color, renders the user's initial, and exports the result as a data URL for <img> tags or as a File for backend uploads. Lightweight and customizable for fast UI integration.
